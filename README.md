# Sushil Kokare

Data Scientist â€¢ Machine Learning Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of data and intelligence, and I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new techniques in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning.

## Current Focus:

- Building powerful ML/DL models: Focus on crafting effective machine learning and deep learning models for various applications.
- Data mastery: Hone your skills in data wrangling (cleaning and preparing data), feature engineering (creating informative features), and visualization (unveiling patterns).
- Data science problem-solving: Apply your data science knowledge to tackle real-world challenges across diverse domains..

## Skills:

- Languages: Python, C++, SQL
- Technologies: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Git, Scikit-learn
- Concepts: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Visualization, Data Manipulation, Version Control, Data Cleaning,
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Projects:

- **Stock Backtesting Tool (Python):** Analyze & backtest stocks using Pandas, Matplotlib, Streamlit. https://analyzestocks.streamlit.app/ 
- **Brain CT Classification (Internship):** Web app for stroke detection via CT scans (Python, TensorFlow, Flask). 


## Research Achievement 

- **Authored a review paper:** "A Survey on Deep Learning for Neuroimaging-based Brain Disorder Analysis,"
- published by CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group.
- DOI: 10.1201/9781003264767-4. <a href='https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003264767-4/survey-deep-learning-neuroimaging-based-brain-disorder-analysis-sushil-kokare-revathy' > Access Paper </a>
